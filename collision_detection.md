# Collision Detection Problem

A collision avoidance system (CAS) is an active safety feature that warns drivers or even triggers the brake in the event of an imminent collision with an object in the path of driving. If a preceding vehicle
is present, the CAS continuously estimates the time to collision (TTC). When the TTC falls below a
lower threshold, the CAS can t hen decide to either warn the driver of the imminent danger or
depending on the system apply the vehicle brakes autonomously. For the engineering task you will
be completing in this course this means that you will need to find a way to compute the TTC to the
vehicle in front.
